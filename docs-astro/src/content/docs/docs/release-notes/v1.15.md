## v1.15.3

### Breaking Changes

Rename variable `hms_docker_plex_ssl_subdomain` to `hms_docker_plex_ssl_public_hostname`

If using the Traefik-to-Plex certificate conversion script, you will need to update the `hms_docker_plex_ssl_public_hostname` variable in `inventory/group_vars/all/plex.yml` to point to the FQDN (eg. `plex.example.com`) instead of just subdomain then re-run the playbook.

You will also need to remove the Traefik cert file (`sudo rm /opt/hms-docker/apps/traefik/config/certs/acme.json`) and then restart Traefik (`docker restart traefik`) for it to rebuild the certificate file with the correct format.

- This is to support the use case when the Traefik cert will have SANs for other subdomains
