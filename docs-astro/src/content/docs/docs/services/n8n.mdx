[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a workflow automation platform that allows you to connect various services together.

## Architecture

The n8n deployment includes two containers:

- **n8n** — The main application server
- **n8n-postgres** — PostgreSQL database for persistent storage

These containers communicate over a dedicated `n8n_net` Docker network.

## Setup

n8n is enabled through the [Container Map](/docs/container-list#container-map). No additional configuration is required — the playbook automatically:

1. Creates the required directory structure
2. Generates a 64-character encryption key for n8n
3. Downloads the PostgreSQL initialization script
4. Configures PostgreSQL with default credentials

## Accessing

Once running, n8n is accessible via Traefik at `n8n.<domain>`. The first time you access it, you'll need to create an owner account.

## Default Database Credentials

The PostgreSQL database uses default credentials that are configured in the `.env` file:

- Root user: `n8nroot`
- Root password: `n8nr00tpassw0rd`
- Application user: `n8nnonroot`
- Application password: `n8nnonr00tpassw0rd`
- Database name: `n8n`

:::caution[Warning]

If you need to change the database credentials, use a [Container Override](/docs/getting-started/container-overrides) to set the environment variables `N8N_POSTGRES_USER`, `N8N_POSTGRES_PASS`, `N8N_POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_USER`, `N8N_POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_PASSWORD`, and `N8N_POSTGRES_DB`.
