## Using Homepage

Homepage is able to integrate directly with Docker, allowing it to "auto-discover" the running containers/services.

Homepage can also integrate with a very large number of the containers in this project, so setting up the connection is very easy.

A number of applications already have their API keys retrieved automatically from their config files during a playbook run (such as Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Bazarr, Plex, Tautulli, and others).

For services that don't support automatic key retrieval, you will need to manually define their API keys in `inventory/group_vars/all/homepage_api_keys.yml`. These can be found in each applications settings page.

### File Security

It is _highly_ recommended to ensure the permissions and ownership of this file is locked down. You can do this by running:

```bash
chmod 0600 inventory/group_vars/all/homepage_api_keys.yml
```

```bash
chown $(whoami):$(whoami) inventory/group_vars/all/homepage_api_keys.yml
```
