## Connecting the Containers to each other

When connecting containers together, such as Prowlarr to Sonarr and Radarr or Sonarr/Radarr to Seerr, use the container name (e.g. `prowlarr` or `radarr`) and the container port (e.g. `prowlarr:9696` or `radarr:7878`).

For the names and port of each container to use, get the `Container Name` and `Container Port` values from the **[Container Map](/docs/container-list#container-map)**.

:::note[Note]

Do **NOT use HTTPS/SSL/TLS when connecting the apps using this method** as it will likely fail. The containers do not have certificates configured for internal communication.

This is safe because all traffic using this method stays within the internal Docker network and never leaves the host.

If you connect apps using your DNS records instead of container names, then you would use HTTPS.

## Prowlarr Example

Here's an example within Prowlarr that would connect it to Radarr:

<Image
  src={prowlarr_example}
  alt="Example connecting an arr app to prowlarr"
  class="rounded-lg border"
/>

## HTTP Proxy for Arr Services

Transmission, qBittorrent, and Deluge all have a HTTP proxy that will route requests through the VPN connection.

You can configure other apps to connect to these containers proxy services by using `transmission:8888`, `qbittorrent:8118`, or `deluge:8118`, depending on which you are using.

<Image
  src={proxy_example}
  alt="Example connecting a proxy to an arr app"
  class="rounded-lg border"
/>
