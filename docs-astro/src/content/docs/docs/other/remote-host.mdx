title: Remote Host Install

## Remote Host

A "remote host" install method is meant for users that have familiarity with Ansible and have a system that already has Ansible installed that will control other hosts.

### Requirements

- Ability to SSH into remote host
- `sudo` privileges on remote host

If installing to a remote host (a different system than where Ansible is installed), you will need to modify your `inventory/hosts.yml` file to specify the remote host:

```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    hmsdockerhost:
      ansible_host: 192.168.1.2 # The IP address of the target host you want to install to
      # Uncomment and modify the following if you have a specific user you use for Ansible:
      #ansible_user: ansibleuser
      #ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /path/to/key/file
      #ansible_ssh_pass: foo #leave as-is if key does not have a password
      # You can also specify host-specific variables here:
      #hms_docker_domain: secondary.example.com
```
