title: AI Usage Disclosures
---

AI has (rightfully) been under fire for generating "slop" code that is insecure or has bugs.

In an effort for full transparency on AI usage within this project, I'm providing this page that outlines where AI has been used.

If an item has bugs or is insecure that is not listed below, that's my own fault.

## AI Usage and Implementations

AI started being used more within this project starting in February 2026. Before this time, AI had only generated the artwork

Below is a list of all places that AI has been used:

- Version checking
- API key extraction optimization
- The logo and other artwork (ComfyUI)
- The `unifi_dns` role (Claude Code)
- The `settings_manager.py` script (ChatGPT, then fixed by Claude Code once I purchased subscription)
