:::tip[Tip]

Please check logs and understand what the logs indicate the error is before submitting an Issue.

Only errors that stop the playbook or prevent it from running will be accepted.

You can always reach out in the Discord server for additional help and troubleshooting.

## Playbook Logs

By default, logs will be stored in the `logs/hms-docker.log` within the `ansible-hms-docker` directory where you downloaded this project to.

Only the most recent playbook run will be logged.

If you encounter an issue/error during the playbook run, please provide the failed task item and its log output if you choose to submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ahembree/ansible-hms-docker/issues) or reach out in the Discord server.

:::note[Note]

Errors for the `Traefik Postreq - Verify all Traefik endpoints are accessible` task are not valid for GitHub Issues as these errors are typically related to your own networking/DNS or container startup.

:::

## Container Logs

You can view individual container logs by running:

```bash
docker logs -f <container name>
```

While container-specific issues are outside the scope of this project, if the underlying cause is due to permissions implemented by this project then please submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ahembree/ansible-hms-docker/issues) or reach out in the Discord server.
