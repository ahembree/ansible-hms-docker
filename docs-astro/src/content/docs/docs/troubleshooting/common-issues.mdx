title: Common Issues

## Port Conflicts

If a container fails to start with a "port already in use" error, another service on the host is using the same port.

**Solutions:**

- Identify the conflicting service: `sudo ss -tlnp | grep <port>`
- Change the containers host port using a [Container Override](/docs/getting-started/container-overrides)
- Stop the conflicting service

See the [Container Map](/docs/container-list#container-map) for the default port mappings. Some containers have modified host ports to avoid overlap (e.g., SABnzbd uses host port `8082` instead of `8080`).

## Permission Issues

If containers cannot read or write files, this is typically a UID/GID mismatch.

**Check your current settings** in `inventory/group_vars/all/container_settings.yml`:

```yaml
container_uid: 1234
container_gid: 1234
```

These should match the owner of your media files. To check file ownership:

```bash
ls -la /path/to/your/media
```

To fix ownership of the container data directory:

```bash
sudo chown -R <uid>:<gid> /opt/hms-docker/apps/
```

## DNS Resolution Failures

If you get `404` errors or cannot access containers via their subdomain:

1. **Verify DNS resolution:** `nslookup <container>.<domain>` — should resolve to your server's IP
2. **Check Traefik logs:** `docker logs -f traefik` — look for routing errors
3. **Verify the container is running:** `docker ps | grep <container>`
4. **Check the container is healthy:** Some containers take time to start. Wait a few minutes and try again.

If using the [UniFi DNS role](/docs/getting-started/dns#unifi-dns-role), verify the DNS records were created in your UniFi console.

## VPN Connectivity

If VPN-enabled containers (Transmission, qBittorrent, Deluge) fail to start or cannot download:

1. **Check container logs:** `docker logs -f <container>` — look for VPN connection errors
2. **Verify VPN credentials** in `inventory/group_vars/all/vpn.yml`
3. **Verify the VPN config file** is placed in the correct directory (see [Download Clients and VPNs](/docs/getting-started/vpn-and-dl-clients))
4. **Check if your VPN provider is supported** by the container image

## Traefik Certificate Issues

If you see SSL/TLS certificate errors:

1. **Start with staging:** Set `traefik_ssl_use_letsencrypt_staging_url: yes` in `inventory/group_vars/all/traefik.yml` to test without hitting rate limits
2. **Check Traefik logs:** `docker logs -f traefik` — look for ACME/Let's Encrypt errors
3. **Verify DNS provider credentials** are correct in `traefik_ssl_dns_provider_environment_vars`
4. **Check DNS propagation:** The DNS challenge requires your DNS provider API to be accessible and the records to propagate

Once staging certificates work correctly, switch to production by setting `traefik_ssl_use_letsencrypt_staging_url: no`.

## Container Override Errors

If you see a validation error about containers not being defined:

```
service "container_name" is not defined in the compose file
```

This means a container listed in your `docker-compose.override.yml` is not enabled. Only enabled containers should be specified in the override file. See [Container Overrides](/docs/getting-started/container-overrides) for details.
