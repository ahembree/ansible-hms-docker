title: App Bootstrapping
---

The app bootstrap tasks automatically configure the connections between supported apps (such as linking Prowlarr to Sonarr/Radarr, or adding download clients) to reduce the time it takes to get up and running.

:::note[Automatic Cleanup]

If a service is later disabled, its connections are automatically removed on the next playbook run. For example, if you disable qBittorrent after bootstrapping, the `HMSD - qBittorrent` download client will be removed from Sonarr and Radarr, and its indexer proxy will be removed from Prowlarr.

:::

## Requirements

This requires DNS records to be properly configured for the following apps:

- Prowlarr

- Sonarr (including 4K instance if enabled)

- Radarr (including 4K instance if enabled)

- Lidarr

:::note[Note]

These tasks will **NOT** work in `check` mode, this is a [limitation of the Ansible URI module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/uri_module.html#attributes)

:::

## Details

The playbook automatically reads API keys from each app's config file to establish connections between services.

To enable, set:

```yaml
#inventory/group_vars/all/app_bootstrap.yml
...
hmsdocker_app_bootstrap: true
...
```

## Connections

These connections are prefixed with `HMSD -` and this prefix is required to work correctly. You can modify the settings of the connection, but not the name, otherwise it will just create another.

It will do the following for each service:

- Prowlarr
  - Configure Indexer Proxies and Tags for the following services (if enabled)
    - FlareSolverr
    - qBittorrent
    - Transmission
    - Deluge

  - Configure the following apps:
    - Sonarr (including 4K)
    - Radarr (including 4K)
    - Lidarr

- Radarr (including 4K instance if enabled)
  - Configure root folder
  - Configure download clients (if enabled):
    - Transmission
    - qBittorrent
    - Deluge

- Sonarr (including 4K instance if enabled)
  - Configure root folder
  - Configure download clients (if enabled):
    - Transmission
    - qBittorrent
    - Deluge

- Lidarr
  - Configure download clients (if enabled):
    - Transmission
    - qBittorrent
    - Deluge

:::note[Note]

If you change the WebUI password for qBittorrent or Deluge after bootstrapping, you will need to manually update the download client password in Sonarr and Radarr.

:::

:::note

FlareSolverr uses Prowlarrs `General -> Proxy` settings. If this setting is invalid, the task will fail.

## Unsupported Services

### Seerrs

The Seerr apps are unsupported due to requiring you to initially authenticate with Plex after the container first starts and complete setup in order for its API key to work.
