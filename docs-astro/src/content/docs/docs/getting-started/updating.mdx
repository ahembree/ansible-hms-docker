title: Updating
---

To easily update from this git repo _**and**_ update your custom variable names (due to deprecating/renaming variables) if you are on a previous release, run:

```bash
make update
```

Previous variable names will still work for at least a year after the change and will be noted as such within the default configs. Please update to resolve.

If any new containers or container controls were added since you last updated, your `container_map.yml` file will also be updated with the defaults for the new container(s) and controls.

Please see the [Release Notes](/docs/release-notes/) if you are updating from a previous version.
