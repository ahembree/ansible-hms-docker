Supported containers:

- Plex
- Emby
- Jellyfin
- Tdarr
- Fileflows
- Unmanic
- Dispatcharr

The variables listed below for each supported GPU type should exist in your `inventory/group_vars/all/gpu.yml` file

## Intel GPU

If you have a supported Intel processor, you can enable Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV) for use within containers.

```yaml
# inventory/group_vars/all/gpu.yml
enable_intel_gpu: true
```

## Nvidia GPU

If you have a [supported Nvidia graphics card](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-support-matrix), you can enable Nvidia GPU transcoding.

:::note

You must install the correct Nvidia driver for your system _before_ running this playbook with the Nvidia GPU support enabled as shown below.

This playbook does _not_ install the required driver, but it will validate it works correctly.

:::

Nvidia drivers are not installed within this playbook due OS version limitations with the official (?) Nvidia `ansible-role-nvidia-driver` role to install the drivers. I question how official it is since it's in the Nvidia GitHub organization but is basically not maintained...

As of writing (February 2026), it finally had pushes to the repo for the first time since August 2022 and they do not maintain the list of supported OS's, so it is unknown if it'd work with Ubuntu 24.04 or not. There was a [pull request](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ansible-role-nvidia-driver/pull/65) to add support for Ubuntu 22.04 but nothing else reflects this supposed support.

```yaml
# inventory/group_vars/all/gpu.yml
enable_nvidia_gpu: true
```
