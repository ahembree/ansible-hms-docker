## Connecting the Containers to each other

When connecting containers together, such as Prowlarr to Sonarr and Radarr or Sonarr/Radarr to Overseerr etc, you can use the name of the container (e.g. `prowlarr` or `radarr`) and then defining the container port to connect to (e.g. `prowlarr:9696` or `radarr:7878`).

For the names and port of each container to use, get the `Container Name` and `Container Port` values from the **[Container Map](/container-list#container-map)**.

:::note[Note]

Do **NOT use HTTPS/SSL/TLS when connecting the apps using this method** as it will likely fail.

This is due to apps not having a certificate by default or having a self-signed certificate.

This may seem insecure, and _technically_ it is, but all communication that uses this method only happens _within the internal Docker network_, so the risk is reduced as the traffic never leaves the system.

If you use your DNS records to connect them, then that is when you would want HTTPS.

## Prowlarr Example

Here's an example within Prowlarr that would connect it to Radarr:

<Image
  src={prowlarr_example}
  alt="Example connecting an arr app to prowlarr"
  class="rounded-lg border"
/>

## HTTP Proxy for Arr Services

Transmission, qBittorrent, and Deluge all have a HTTP proxy that will route requests through the VPN connection.

You can configure other apps to connect to these containers proxy services by using `transmission:8888`, `qbittorrent:8118`, or `deluge:8118`, depending on which you are using.

  src={proxy_example}
  alt="Example connecting a proxy to an arr app"
  class="rounded-lg border"
/>
