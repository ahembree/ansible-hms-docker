title: Design Decisions
---

Below are some of the ideas behind why certain decisions were made within this project (and for me to remember why I did things this way)

## Variable Layout

The variables being stored in `inventory/group_vars/all` was decided due to [Ansible variable precedence](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable).

This layout allows someone to specify multiple hosts in the `inventory/hosts.yml` file (or other custom inventory file) each with their own specific variable settings with a "common" shared config between them. See the [Remote Host docs](/other/remote-host).

Use case: development instance with different domain and/or SSL certificate but all other settings the same

## Containers

### Gluetun

Gluetun was not implemented because adding `network_mode: "service:gluetun"` to other containers, such as qbittorrent, did not fully protect the traffic (see [this discussion post](https://github.com/ahembree/ansible-hms-docker/discussions/116#discussioncomment-12888175))

## DNS Service

The lack of a DNS service, like PiHole or AdGuard Home, is intentional since a crucial network service like that should be decoupled from this setup.

## Key Material Storage

### Authentik and Tracerr Secret Keys

Since the `.env` file will be continually updated with new values and the 2 randomly generated values for Authentik need to remain persistent, Ansible will read/`slurp` these 2 files created and retrieve the values, ensuring the values within the `.env` are the same each time during every playbook run.

To ensure these key and pgpass files are not changed by Ansible, `force: no` is set on the template resource that creates these files.
