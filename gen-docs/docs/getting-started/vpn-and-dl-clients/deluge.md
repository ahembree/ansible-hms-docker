# Deluge

This setup uses the container maintained here: [binhex/arch-delugevpn](https://github.com/binhex/arch-delugevpn)

Settings mentioned below should already exist in your `inventory/group_vars/all/vpn.yml` file

The default password is `deluge`

:::note

If you update the Deluge password _and_ are using the automatic app bootstrap, you will need to update the password for the `HMSD - Deluge` download client in the Sonarr and Radarr app(s)
