# Version 1.12

## Breaking Changes

### Cloudflare Tunnel and Cloudflare DDNS

These items have been moved to the `container_map.yml` file, but the old variables to enabled (should) still work

### Watchtower

This has been moved to the container map and enabled by default

### Authentik

You will need to do manual steps BEFORE running the playbook, otherwise Authentik will fail to start. These steps are available in [these Authentik docs](../config-docs/Authentik.md#upgrading-authentik)

Authentik has been updated to its current latest available version, but going from the previously supported version by this project to the most recent is not a straight path due to a change in the postgresql version

Follow the steps in [these Authentik docs](../config-docs/Authentik.md#upgrading-authentik)

### Wizarr

Fixed permissions to use non-root user and changed volume mount path. These items were to align it with the official documentation for installation.

## Removed Containers

For the first time, a container has been removed.

Readarr - Officially retired and the docker image has been deprecated and will fail to download new images with the error `no matching manifest for linux/amd64 in the manifest list entries`. See more on the Readarr homepage: https://readarr.com/

## New Variables

- `inventory/group_vars/all/authentik.yml`: `hmsdocker_authentik_enabled_through_cftunnel`

## Deprecated Variables

- `inventory/group_vars/all/authentik.yml`: `authentik_enabled`, this was not in use anywhere that I could find, Authentik enablement is only handled by the container map (whereas it was _either_ before)

- `inventory/group_vars/all/container_settings.yml`: `container_enable_auto_updates`

## Bug Fixes

- Fix Traefik middleware declarations, now all middleware should correctly apply
- Fix Sabnzbd `host_whitelist` appending
- Ensure qBittorrent config directory exists in prereqs so config can be written
- Remove duplicate Authentik task runs
- Remove Authentik protection from Authentik
