# Version 1.12

## Breaking Changes

### Authentik

You will need to do manual steps BEFORE running the playbook, otherwise Authentik will fail to start. These steps are available in [these Authentik docs](../config-docs/Authentik.md#upgrading-authentik)

Authentik has been updated to its current latest available version, but going from the previously supported version by this project to the most recent is not a straight path due to a change in the postgresql version

Follow the steps in [these Authentik docs](../config-docs/Authentik.md#upgrading-authentik)

### Wizarr

Fixed permissions to use non-root user and changed volume mount path. These items were to align it with the official documentation for installation.

## Removed Containers

For the first time, a container has been removed.

Readarr - Officially retired and the docker image has been deprecated and will fail to download new images with the error `no matching manifest for linux/amd64 in the manifest list entries`. See more on the Readarr homepage: https://readarr.com/

## New Variables

- `inventory/group_vars/all/authentik.yml`: `hmsdocker_authentik_enabled_through_cftunnel`

## Deprecated Variables
