# Version 1.7

## Breaking changes

Renamed the following variables as some are no longer used only for Transmission

If running a previous version, run `make update` to pull the latest version of the code, it will then also replace these variables in the `inventory/group_vars/all/transmission.yml` file automatically.

`transmission_vpn_provider` --> `hmsdocker_vpn_provider`
`transmission_vpn_user`  --> `hmsdocker_vpn_user`
`transmission_vpn_pass`  --> `hmsdocker_vpn_pass`
`transmission_ovpn_config_file`  --> `hmsdocker_vpn_custom_config_file_name`
`transmission_ovpn_config_local_path`  --> `transmission_ovpn_config_local_dir`

## New Containers

* qbittorrent
* deluge

Both of these containers come with a VPN built in like the Transmission container has had but these also support WireGuard

If you have an existing install, there is a new variable required for these `hmsdocker_vpn_type`, Add this to a `vpn.yml` file, or any other variable file you want in `inventory/group_vars/all/`

This variable accepts these values and selects which VPN type to use for the new containers:

* `openvpn`
* `wireguard`

## Other changes

* change and rename default VPN creds file from `transmission.yml` to `vpn.yml`
* bump docusaurus versions
* add debug mode that will output more task info, but will also now expose "secrets" when running this
* reduces playbook output size so its easier to see what containers it is actioning on

## Misc

* remove a lot of containers from GitHub Actions due to reduced disk size
* update ansible-lint ignores
* update some docs
  * add proxy connection guide
  * add info on adding other containers on same host to traefik
  * add docs for new containers
* update handlers to use `docker_compose_v2` module instead of shell command
* rename `transmission.yml` task to `vpn_validation.yml`
